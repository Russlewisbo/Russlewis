You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === \u0026#39;undefined\u0026#39; ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\u0026#34;./line-chart.json\u0026#34;, function(chart) { Plotly.plot(\u0026#39;chart-953172648\u0026#39;, chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math.

Pharmacometric model-informed dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) have been advanced as strategies for individualising antibiotic dosing in critically-ill patients, but the availability of these tools and expertise for implementation (especially for newer antibiotics) is often not available. The ACUTE project (Adapting Bloodculture systems to monitor antimicrobial efficacy) proposes to develop time-to positivity (Tpos) reported most continuously monitored bloodculture incubators in clinical microbiology laboratories into an a surrogate pharmacodynamic biomarker for antibacterial bactericidal activity. In this project, we propose to develop this assay as a ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù for monitoring ceftazidime-avibactam therapy of KPC-carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. (KPC-Kp) This will be accomplished through two specific aims and several workpackages. The first specific aim will establish the quantitative relationships between Tpos and several representative KPC-Kp strains in the absence and after exposure to a range of clinically-relevant exposures of ceftazidime-avibactam. The second specific aim will measure in 20 critically-ill patients receiving ceftazidime-avibactam treatment for KPC-KP bloodstream infections using KPC-Kp ‚Äúindicator‚Äù strains or the patient‚Äôs own isolate, and correlate Tpos results with blood concentration-time courses of ceftazidime and avibactam and PK/PD target attainment (free drug T\u0026gt;MIC ) simulated for each patient using Bayesian-informed estimates of individual PK parameters from population pharmacokinetic models and LC/MS/MS analysis of ceftazidime-avibactam in serum. This study will form the basis for the broader development and validation of Tpos as a surrogate pharmacodynamic biomarker for antimicrobial activity in serum, that could potentially be used for screening or monitoring antimicrobial efficacy in the critically-ill patient.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"117bfd07300017f63d1df2c78ecc9246","permalink":"https:russlewisid.com/project/acute/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/acute/","section":"project","summary":"Developing bloodculture time-to positivity as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for monitoring antibiotic therapy of Gram-negative bloodstream infections","tags":["PK/PD"],"title":"Adapting bloodculture systems to monitor antimicrobial efficacy","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nLink to Online Risk Calculator Giannella M et al.

Discrimination and prediction accuracy for CRE infection was acceptable on derivation (area under the curve [AUC], 74.6; Brier index, 16.3) and bootstrapped validation dataset (AUC, 73.9; Brier index, 16.6). Decision-curve analysis suggested net benefit of model-directed intervention over default strategies (treat all, treat none) when CRE infection probability exceeded 10%.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9c1aaca3222419d1ee4ce2a00e262ea4","permalink":"https:russlewisid.com/project/cre_risk_olt/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cre_risk_olt/","section":"project","summary":"Development of a prognistic model for CRE infection in patients colonized pre-and post-liver transplantation","tags":["Prognostic models"],"title":"Predicting CRE infection after liver transplantation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nPolymorphisms in genes encoding fungal pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system are associated with increased risk of invasive aspergillosis (IA), but incorporation genetic risk factors in clinical decision making remains limited. We propose to develop a combined clinical/genetic risk model suitable for accurately predicting an individual patient‚Äôs risk for developing IA within 60 days of admission for chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (AML/MDS). We will develop a clinical risk model from a large data registry of 788 patients over 2,713 hospital admissions (2007-2020) for AML/MDS treatment that was associated with a 5.5% incidence of EORTC/MSG-defined probable or proven mold disease. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 genes encoding fungal PRRs will be analyzed in parallel with relevant myeloid mutations from banked samples from next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis in a nested cohort of 234 patients (534 admissions) from 2017-2020. A polygenic risk score (PRS) will be developed to explore interactions with clinical risk factors and fungal PRR/myeloid SNPs to develop an absolute risk prediction model for supporting clinical decisions in the management of invasive mold disease in patients undergoing treatment of AML/MDS.","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"https:russlewisid.com/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"Incorporating genetic risk factors in a clinical risk prediction model for aspergillosis","tags":["Prognostic models","Invasive aspergillosis","Genetic risk factors"],"title":"Prognostic aspergillosis risk prediction models with leukemia sequencing","type":"project"}]
