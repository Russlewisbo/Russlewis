abstract: Over the past 10 years, the number of targeted therapies for haematological malignancies has substantially increased, and many new drugs have entered the market. Many of these therapies have shown improved disease-free survival and  reduced  toxicity  compared  with  existing  treatments,  especially  in  older  patients.  However,  most  of  these  new drugs  undergo  extensive  hepatic  metabolism  and  exhibit  moderate  to  severe  drug–drug  interactions  with  triazole antifungal agents, which are essential for the prophylaxis and long-term treatment of invasive fungal infections. In this Review, we give a comprehensive overview of all known drug–drug interactions between new targeted drugs for haematological malignancies and antifungal drugs, in particular the triazoles. We begin with a general background on drug–drug interactions. Next, we provide a management strategy for the use of each targeted haematological drug, and discuss the possible role of therapeutic drug monitoring for both the triazole and the haematological drugs. This Review  aims  to  provide  practical  guidance  to  clinical  haematologists  on  managing  the  complex  interplay  between targeted therapies for haematological malignancies and triazole antifungal drugs, to pursue better outcomes for their patients.
